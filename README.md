Draw Detection: It also detects when the game ends in a draw if there are no more empty cells available for either player to make a move.

Error Handling: The code is designed to handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing informative error messages to guide the players.

Reset Option: After each game concludes, players have the option to start a new game without exiting the program.

GitHub Hosting: The entire project, including the Python code, README documentation, and possibly other resources, is hosted on GitHub, making it accessible to a wider community of developers and enthusiasts.

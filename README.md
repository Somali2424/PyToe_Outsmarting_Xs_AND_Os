The logic in coding behind the Tic-Tac-Toe game is:


**Interactive Gameplay:** The game offers a command-line interface where two players can take turns to make their moves by specifying the row and column for their respective symbols, 'X' and 'O'.

**Winning Logic:** The program includes a winning condition check, ensuring the game recognizes when a player has won by forming a row, column, or diagonal of their symbols.

**Draw Detection:** It also detects when the game ends in a draw if there are no more empty cells available for either player to make a move.

**Error Handling:** The code is designed to handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing informative error messages to guide the players.

**Reset Option:** After each game concludes, players have the option to start a new game without exiting the program.
